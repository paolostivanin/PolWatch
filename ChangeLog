	* Configure script
	
??/??/2013 - v1.0-alpha2
	* Daemon (for automatic scan)
	* Log file
	* Scan with pthread (??)
	* Encrypted DB (??)
	
*********************************************
* ToDo:
* - with manual scan if hash is different prompt the action that have to be done (U update, D delete, I ignore for example)
* - with automatic scan if hash is different read the action that have to be done from configuration file
* - The log file report the Update/Deleted/Ignored files
* - Configuration file will have: 1) action to do when file hash is different from previous one; 2) daemon execution interval?;
* - To do the scan more quickly i can split the scan into 2 part with pthread (P1: start->50% -- P2: 50%+1->end)
* - Database is encryped so it cannot be modified
